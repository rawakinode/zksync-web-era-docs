# RPC Providers

### 1RPC
[1RPC](https://www.1rpc.io/) is the first and only RPC relay with infrastructure that is fully attested on-chain. Anyone can verify its integrity by assessing the relay's hardware and software components. Now 1RPC support zkSync Mainnet.

### Alchemy

[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/zksync) is a leading developer platform with powerful APIs, SDKs, and tools to build truly scalable onchain apps. Deploy on zkSync Mainnet and zkSync Sepolia Testnet using Alchemy's free and [paid plans](https://www.alchemy.com/pricing).

### Ankr

[Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/zksync_era/) provides private and public RPC endpoints for zkSync, powered by a globally distributed and decentralized network of nodes. They offer free and [paid plans](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/pricing/) with increased request limits.

### Blast
[Blast](https://blastapi.io/chains/zksync) custom APIs offer optimized throughput and reduced latency for transactions on Metis and enable access to real-time data, transaction history and network status. 

## Blockdaemon
[Blockdaemon](https://www.blockdaemon.com/zksync) supports zkSync, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to enable scalable, low-cost, and secure transactions on the Ethereum network. It is designed to help overcome the limitations of Ethereum’s scalability and high transaction fees while maintaining a high level of privacy, security, and decentralization.

### BlockPI

[BlockPI](https://blockpi.io/zksync) is a high-quality, robust, and efficient RPC service network that provides access to zkSync nodes with [free and paid plans](https://docs.blockpi.io/documentations/pricing).

### Chainstack

[Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/) is a leading blockchain infrastructure providing company. Build, run and scale blockchain applications using Chainstack nodes.

### Chainbase

[Chainbase](https://chainbase.com/chainNetwork/zkSync) API is supercharged for reliability, data correctness, and scalability. Chainbase will handle all the forks, upgrades, and network interruptions

### Chainlist
[ChainList](https://chainlist.org/chain/324) is a list of EVM networks include zkSync. Users can use the information to connect their wallets and Web3 middleware providers to the appropriate Chain ID and Network ID to connect to the correct chain.

### DRPC

[DRPC](https://drpc.org/public-endpoints/zksync) offers access to distributed network of independent third-party partners and public nodes for zkSync. They provide a free tier that allows for an unlimited amount of requests over public nodes, or a paid tier which provides access to all providers, as well as other additional features.

### GetBlock

[GetBlock](https://getblock.io/nodes/zksync/) provides access to zkSync API endpoint for your project. With GetBlock you don’t need to know how to run zkSync nodes as they are already are available for mainnet and testnets.

### NOWNodes

[NOWNodes](https://nownodes.io/nodes) provides Full Node for zkSync with is a high-quality standart and 24/7 support. Free Plan is available.

### Quicknode

[QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/zkSync) offers access to hosted zkSync nodes as part of their free Discover Plan. You can configure add-ons, like "Trace Mode" and "Archive Mode" for an additional cost by upgrading to one of their paid plans.

### Unifra

[Unifra](https://unifra.io/) is a Web3 developer platform that provides tools, APIs, and node infrastructure, and provides access to zkSync nodes that are nodes are reliable, scalable, and easy to use.
